            <!-- <p> The corona pandemic has uncovered a number of systemic inequalities with regard to
                education and access to learning opportunities. Across countries and settings in the EU, the necessity
                to resort to the digital sphere with learning has shown that it is not equally possible for all members
                of a society to follow suit. Particularly vulnerable groups, including people with a migration
                background, people with a refugee background, or non-native speakers, who were already having a
                difficult experience before. These groups have now been even more strongly left behind in terms of
                education.</p> -->

            <!-- <p>Working with social workers as well as the newly emerged profession of cultural mediators who is acting
                as a bridge towards municipalities and local educational institutions, such as schools, and extending
                their personal reach-out towards the digital sphere by means of chatbots, the SEEDS project proposes a
                combination of social and digital outreach to mitigate this effect. Needed learning contents will be
                communicated in a new way by means of chatbots, where municipalities and educational institutions can
                create learning materials in a pre-defined processes, and cultural mediators, social workers, or
                individual learners themselves can access the learning material that teachers created, to enhance the
                learnersâ€™ educational experience.</p> -->
