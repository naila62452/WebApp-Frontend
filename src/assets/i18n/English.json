Across countries and settings in the EU, the necessity to resort to the digital sphere with learning has shown that it is not equally possible for all members of a society to follow suit. Particularly vulnerable groups, including people with a migration background, people with a refugee background, or non-native speakers, who were already having a difficult experience before. These groups have now been even more strongly left behind in terms of education.",

Needed learning contents will be communicated in a new way by means of chatbots, where municipalities and educational institutions can create learning materials in a pre-defined processes, and cultural mediators, social workers, or individual learners themselves can access the learning material that teachers created, to enhance the learners’ educational experience.",
