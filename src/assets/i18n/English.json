Across countries and settings in the EU, the necessity to resort to the digital sphere with learning has shown that it is not equally possible for all members of a society to follow suit. Particularly vulnerable groups, including people with a migration background, people with a refugee background, or non-native speakers, who were already having a difficult experience before. These groups have now been even more strongly left behind in terms of education.",

Needed learning contents will be communicated in a new way by means of chatbots, where municipalities and educational institutions can create learning materials in a pre-defined processes, and cultural mediators, social workers, or individual learners themselves can access the learning material that teachers created, to enhance the learners’ educational experience.",

Due to the lack of access to educational institutions and little or no equipment (Tablets, or Laptops and PCs) with necessary digital technologies, young people found it difficult to follow classes. ICT and above all the smartphone can be used here to mitigate this deficit. The needs and challenges of the target group must be taken into account (i.e. no up-to-date smartphones with outdated software). Our idea is to communicate learning content to vulnerable people in a new way by using chat bots.",
