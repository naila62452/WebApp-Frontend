        "Home Text": "Welcome to SEED! The corona pandemic has uncovered a number of systemic inequalities with regard to education and access to learning opportunities. Across countries and settings in the EU, the necessity to resort to the digital sphere with learning has shown that it is not equally possible for all members of a society to follow suit. Particularly vulnerable groups, including people with a migration background, people with a refugee background, or non-native speakers, who were already having a difficult experience before. These groups have now been even more strongly left behind in terms of education.",

Needed learning contents will be communicated in a new way by means of chatbots, where municipalities and educational institutions can create learning materials in a pre-defined processes, and cultural mediators, social workers, or individual learners themselves can access the learning material that teachers created, to enhance the learners’ educational experience.",
